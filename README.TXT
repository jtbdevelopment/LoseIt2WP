http://code.google.com/p/google-mail-xoauth-tools/

http://code.google.com/p/asmack/ (which in turn utilizes code from)
http://harmony.apache.org/ (which is actually the code used from asmack)

It utilizes libraries from:
http://code.google.com/p/javamail-android/
http://code.google.com/p/oauth-signpost/
http://commons.apache.org/codec/

Most Icons Came from
http://www.androidicons.com/ by Guenther Beyer under creative commons
except for app icon which is clearly a combination of the Lose It! and WordPress icons.


Ideas from
http://www.androidhive.info/2012/02/android-custom-listview-with-image-and-text/ - highlight on list
