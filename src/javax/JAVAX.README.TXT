As noted elsewhere, this package is originally from asmack library
http://code.google.com/p/asmack/
which appeared to incorporate code from the Apache Harmony code base.

I removed the unused asmack classes and renamed the apache classes from
org.apache.harmony.javax... to javax as they need to be direct matches for classes for android javamail to work

No other modifications or credit claimed.
